This folder contains discrete data of a height-profile "h" from a "Balokotaiah-Solution": h5.txt contains the spatially discrete height-information of the fallingfilm at the 5th timestep etc... 
In ErrorEstimationBalakotaiahSinusTESTSPLINESFileInput.cpp the spatially discrete height-data is interpolated with cubic splines for each discrete timestep.
