This folder contains discrete data of a volume-flow "q" from a "Balokotaiah-Solution": q5.txt contains the spatially discrete volume-flow-information of the fallingfilm at the 5th timestep etc... 
In ErrorEstimationBalakotaiahSinusTESTSPLINESFileInput.cpp the spatially discrete volume-flow-data is interpolated with cubic splines for each discrete timestep.
